    Hi there, this is Lucia. I'm super new to coding (self-teaching in progress) 
    and so far I haven't had much opportunity to use Git & GitHub.
    
    However, as I'll build more coding skills (and a bit more confidence too), 
    I hope to push some more code in here.
    
    Until that time, you can have a look at some case-studies I worked on during
    my internship.
    
    I know the format isn't ideal, but that's what I can do at the moment. I promise
    I'll get better soon!
    
    Cheers.
